/* Append your initials to every css class you make.
   Ex. If I'm making a entry-button style, it would be 'entry-button-ak'

	Use .class to get things by class:
		.button {
			color: 'red';
			font-color: 'white';
		}
		
		This would make all things that have class="button" red with white text

	Use #id to get things by id:
		#chat-button {
			color: 'blue';
		}

		This would make only things that have id="chat-button" blue.
